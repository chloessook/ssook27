<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html52/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Each morning</a> I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
(Take a look at yourself)
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord what you're doing to me
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord!
Somebody, somebody
<strong>Can anybody find me somebody to <u>love</u></strong>?

<p style="margin-top:45px;">
Love of my life, don't leave me
You've stolen my love, you now desert me
Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back (back)
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me
